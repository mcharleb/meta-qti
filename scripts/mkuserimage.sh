## This script builds a linux root filesystem image.
## 
## Creating a rootfs image necessarily requires root privilege. This script uses "sudo" to execute certain commands
## as root. The user running this script should have sudo access, and will be prompted to enter their password at
## when the script runs.
## The following commands in this script are run with sudo:
##   - /bin/mount
##   - /bin/cp
##   - /bin/umount
##   - /bin/chown
##   - /usr/bin/find
##   - /usr/bin/stat
##   - /tmp/make_ext4fs
##
## The last one, /tmp/make_ext4fs is the make_ext4fs copied by this script, from where it was compiled
## in the source tree. This copying is needed for easier automation  (see below)
##
## Automation:
## sudo requires a password to be entered at run time, which means this script requires user intervention. To
## automate this, the sudo permission can be added with NOPASSWD option for the above commands (notice that
## copying make_ext4fs to /tmp makes it independent of the path where the source tree was built, so you don't
## need to keep changing the sudo permission for every new source tree).
## E.g.
##   To give allow user "johndoe", on machine  "builder", add the following line to /etc/sudoers
##   johndoe builder = NOPASSWD: /bin/mount, /bin/cp, /bin/umount, /tmp/make_ext4fs
